# Modelling of Diabetes for Prediction
Diabetes mellitus is a disease of inadequate control of blood glucose.  Whilst often thought to only have type-1 and type-2 (previously known as 'juvenile' and 'adult onset'); there are actually multiple classifications, including type 1, type 2, maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), gestational diabetes, neonatal diabetes and steroid-induced diabetes[^1]. 

Almost 1.9 million Australians have diabetes, with over 300 developing it every day.  Diabetes is the seventh most common cause of death by disease in Australia, and causes significant complications including blindness, amputations, heart disease and kidney disease [^2].  Approximately 1.3 million people are hospitalised with diabetes-related conditions every year [^3].  

For this; we are looking primarily at type-2 diabetes, as this (and insulin resistance) commonly develops with aging. Type-2 is commonly known where there is an imbalance between insulin levels and sensitivity, causing functional deficit of insulin[^1]. 

We are aiming to look at a predictive model for type-2 diabetes to predict diabetes risk, in order to enable persons to work with medical practitioners and carers to enable early intervention and assessment.  Strong international evidence shows diabetes prevention programs can assist in prevention of type-2 diabetes in up to 58% of cases [^4]. 

We are planning to in the future look at integration of Flash Glucose monitors or Blood Glucose Monitors to augment this to ensure better outcomes, as well as push requests and notifications from the device to advise people of reminders for insulin, food, exercise and medication.  This would also be augmented by questionnaires that could be set up from the dashboard to check in regularly.

## Definitions and Diagnosis for Diabetes

For this, we are looking at diabetes and looking to further analysis by using prediabetes as well for prediction.

As part of the work, we researched diabetes, symptoms, diagnosis thresholds in order to ascertain further technical understanding of the disease and how to assess data and datasets that we would use.

We also looked at finding data that had prediabetes, as being able to predict prior to diagnosis of diabetes could lead to better health outcomes, and potentially enable prevention or delay of developing diabetes.

Definitions and glossary of terms:
For further info, refer to the GLUCOSEMONITORINGRESEARCH.md file
- Blood Glucose Level (BGL) 
- Blood Glucose - level of glucose in your blood.
- HbA1c (also known as 'glycated heamoglobin).  Does not require fasting or prep; tests the amount of glycated haemoglobin.
- Fasting - inital blood glucose level taken, after not eating for 12 hours prior (generally)
- 2 hr glucose - blood glucose level taken at 2hrs after fasting, after having consumed a specificied glucose solution. 
- Random - Random time blood test.
- Oral glucose tolerance test - a test where a patient fasts for 
- Target Range - the specified BGL target range
- Time in Target - time BGL is in target range
- Finger prick - device to piece finger (lancet) to extract blood drop
- Flash Glucose - continuous blood glucose monitor that reads and transmits continuously
- Glucose monitor - can be used to take blood glucose from a finger prick and strip, singular reading per strip, not continuous
- Hypoglycaemia (also known as 'hypos') - BGL below 4mmol/L
- Hyperglycaemia - BGL above 15mmol/L

Diagnostic criteria for diabetes:
- Diagnostic criteria for Diabetes as per Australian Diabetes Society, 'Clinical Guidelines, HbA1c for Diagnosis of Diabetes Mellitus (May 2023)' [^5] is: 
    - 1. HbA1c ≥6.5% (48 mmol/mol) 
    - 2. Fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L 
    - 3. Random glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L 
    - 4. On a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test: fasting glucose ≥7.0 mmol/L or 2 hr glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L 

- Diagnostic criteria for Pre-Diabetes in Australia as per Royal Australian College of General Practicioners (RACGP) [^6] is;  
    - Prediabetes: Diagnostic definitions of impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired glucose tolerance (IGT)11 
    - The presence of prediabetes is defined according to the results of a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). 
 
- IFG: 
    - 1. fasting glucose 6.1–6.9 mmol/L, and 
    - 2. two-hour glucose <7.8 mmol/L 

- IGT: 
    - 1. fasting glucose <7 mmol/L, and 
    - 2. two-hour glucose ≥7.8 mmol/L and ≤11 mmol/L. 

Common Risk Assessment Tool:
- Below is the currently Australian Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool (AUDRISK) features that are used to assess the risk of developing diabetes in the next five years [^7], [^8]. This helps us look at potential features that may assist us.

    - 1. Age 
    - 2. Gender 
    - 3a. Descent 
    - 3b. Location of Birth 
    - 4. Family history of Diabetes 
    - 5. Previous high blood glucose 
    - 6. Medication for high blood pressure 
    - 7. Smoking 
    - 8. Vegetable intake 
    - 9. Exercise 
    - 10. Waist measurement 

- If you scored higher than 12 on the AUDRISK, you would be recommended to seek medical advice, and take a Blood Glucose test to assess if you have diabetes [^9].

- Of note; over the age of 65, Australian's should be screened for Diabetes every three years, if no other risk factors exist, in which case, it would be more frequently [^10]. 

Common symptoms of type-2 diabetes [^11], [^12]:
- Common symptoms can take a period of time, even years to develop.
    - 1. feeling very thirsty 
    - 2. needing to urinate more often than usual 
    - 3. blurred vision 
    - 4. feeling tired 
    - 5. losing weight unintentionally  

Common damage due to diabetes includes [^11], [^12]:
- Common damage due to diabetes can include, but is not limited to:
    - 1. Damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves. 
    - 2. Higher risk of health problems including heart attack, stroke and kidney failure. 
    - 3. Permanent vision loss by damaging blood vessels in the eyes. 
    - 4. Nerve damage and poor blood flow, especially to extremities such as feet. This can cause foot ulcers and may lead to amputation. This can also lead to increased risks of falls, especially for the elderly.

### Previous datasets used
The previous datasets have been disgarded for the following reasons:

- [Dataset 1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iammustafatz/diabetes-prediction-dataset)  
This Dataset was discarded for use, due to questions about the provenence of the data, accuracy, veractiy, as well as measures in the dataset.  

Concerns include the original poster refusing to provide provence of where the data is from [^14] when it was collected and how [^15] or what specific control and measure for Blood Glucose was taken, or what type of Blood Glucose it was (fasting, 2-hour, etc) [^16], which would be a requirement for assessing Diabetes from this measure, and specifies it 'appears to be random'.  As such this dataset is no longer being used.

- [Dataset 2](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/529/early+stage+diabetes+risk+prediction+dataset)

 was a very small sample of 520, from a questionaire in hospital.
Whilst good features, and has features that are symptoms of diabetes, it is a subset of people who have presented to a hospital, and is a small sample.  The features also are symptoms; so whilst they enable diagnosis, they do not enable lifestyle changes to assist the person, as they are already present.

## Approach
Techncial research into diabetes, symptoms, diagnosis, etc was understaken to gather a good understanding of the disease, and to enable accurate and informated analysis.
After the original datasets were analysed; they were discarded for use as noted above.

Further research into datasets was undertaken; and several were located that would be of use.  They are referenced above.

These have been analysed, and further analysis is being undertaken to ascertain a prediction model for diabetes, and hopefully prediabetes.

# Research into future potential features

A componant of this feature was to look into potential Glucose Monitoring options for the sensor.

Technical research would show that this can fall into two categories - active glucose monitoring, with integration of glucose monitoring to the sensor, and active glucose montioring, where the glucose monitor is connected to a dashboard or alternative device that pushes alerts to the user.

Current possible types of Glucose Monitoring:
Glucose monitoring
- Flash Glucose - continuous montior [^17]
- Glucose Monitoring - finger prick [^18] 
- Wearable Sweat-Glucose Sensors[^19][^20][^21] 

Why continuous monitoring?  Why would this be important?
A lot of things affect blood glucose, including (but not limited to):
- Food
- Exercise
- Illness
- Medication
- Alcohol
- Stress
- Environment
- How you check your blood glucose

Continuous monitoring would enable real time checking, and would ensure better outcomes for the patient.

Limitation, however, are that this can not be currently integrated into the sensor; but could be integrated into the dashboard (when it is made), and then enable push notifications to the sensor for alerts. 

There are currently different apps (eg - [^22], [^23]) that would enable integration potentially in the furture.

Of note; this is medical data, so would require appropriate assessment of options in order to integrate.

Standard finger prick, with recording of data to the dashboard is also an option; this could be done manually, with the user inputting their values each day, and then track progression.

There are also multiple testing pertaining to wearable sweat-glucose monitoring; this is still in early stages, but could be an option for later iterations.

Prediabetes vs Diabetes.

Why look at prediabetes?  Why not just diabetes? 
- Prediabetes and Diabetes
Preventing diabetes is best, and by predicting it when it is at the prediabetes stage, means that you can potentially reverse it, prior to it becoming diabetes.  This leads to better health outcomes overall [^24],[^25],[^26],[^27],[^28],[^29],[^30],[^31].

Dashboard
- If the dashboard is able to not only record data, but share and push advice and alerts to the person, this would enable 

Alerts
Potential for an alert when:
 - Blood glucose is too high / low
 - Time to check blood glucose
 - Time to take insulin, food, or medication
 - Alerts for how the person is
